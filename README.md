👋 Hey there! I'm **Harshit Bhardwaj** — a CSE (Hons.) undergrad specializing in AI & ML @ Chandigarh University 🧠💻  
🚀 Turning coffee ☕ into code and ideas into intelligent systems.

🛠️ **What I Build:**  
- 🤖 AI agents & CV models (95%+ accurate age/gender & semantic segmentation systems)  
- 💬 LLM-powered apps using LangChain, Claude v2, GPT-4 (like travel planners & chatbots)  
- 📸 Real-time detection systems (OpenCV + Firebase)  
- 🌐 Full-stack AI tools with React, Python, and cloud integration (AWS, Supabase)

📌 **Currently:**  
- Building smarter pipelines using 🧠 PyTorch, TensorFlow & LangChain  
- Exploring the intersection of LLMs, NLP, and edge AI  
- Working on cool stuff that makes life easier for the *next billion* 💡

🧠 **Past:**  
- AI Intern @ **Intel**, fine-tuned SegFormer achieving 96.3% mIoU on custom datasets  
- Published 3 research papers 📄 in AI & Interdisciplinary Tech
